- **Preprocess/**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing. Includes a `README.md` detailing the preprocessing workflow.
- **Model/**: Contains scripts for the retrieval method. Includes a `README.md` detailing the retrieval workflow.
- **Evaluation/**: Contains scripts for evaluating the model's performance. Includes a `README.md` detailing the evaluation workflow.

## Usage

Need to follow the following order as below:

### Data Preprocessing

Navigate to the `Preprocess` directory and follow the instructions in the [Preprocess README](Preprocess/README.md) to clean and prepare your data.

### Retrieval Model

Navigate to the `Model` directory and follow the instructions in the [Model README](Model/README.md) to run the retrieval model.

### Evaluation

Navigate to the `Evaluation` directory and follow the instructions in the [Evaluation README](Evaluation/README.md) to calculate the precision of the model's predictions.
